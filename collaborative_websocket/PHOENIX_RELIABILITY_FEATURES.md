# Phoenix Channels Reliable Event Delivery Implementation

This document outlines how Phoenix Channels and Elixir's OTP features are leveraged to create a robust, reliable real-time collaboration system.

## Phoenix-Specific Reliability Features

### 1. **Channel Replies for Acknowledgments**

Phoenix Channels provide built-in reply mechanisms that are perfect for acknowledgment systems:

```elixir
# Server-side: Handle acknowledgment with automatic reply
def handle_in("ack", %{"sequence_number" => sequence_number}, socket) do
  user_id = socket.assigns.user_id
  ReliableSessionState.acknowledge_event(user_id, sequence_number)
  {:reply, :ok, socket}  # ← Automatic reply to client
end

# Client-side: Send with reply handling
channel.push('ack', {sequence_number: 42})
  .receive('ok', () => console.log('ACK confirmed'))
  .receive('error', (error) => console.log('ACK failed'))
  .receive('timeout', () => console.log('ACK timeout'))
```

### 2. **Phoenix.PubSub for Distributed Broadcasting**

Unlike manual user tracking, Phoenix.PubSub handles distributed messaging across nodes:

```elixir
# Broadcast events with process isolation
defp broadcast_event_with_tracking(event, user_ids) do
  PubSub.broadcast(
    CollaborativeWebsocket.PubSub,
    "session:room",
    {:reliable_event, event, user_ids}
  )
end

# Automatic message routing to all subscribed channels
def handle_info({:reliable_event, event, _user_ids}, socket) do
  ref = push(socket, "event", %{event: event, ack_required: true})
  {:noreply, assign(socket, :pending_ack, {ref, event.sequence_number})}
end
```

### 3. **GenServer for Fault-Tolerant State Management**

The `ReliableSessionState` GenServer provides automatic recovery and supervised restarts:

```elixir
defmodule CollaborativeWebsocket.ReliableSessionState do
  use GenServer
  
  # Automatic cleanup with OTP timers
  def init(_) do
    :timer.send_interval(30_000, self(), :cleanup_and_heartbeat)
    {:ok, initial_state()}
  end
  
  # Handle user timeouts with process monitoring
  def handle_info(:cleanup_and_heartbeat, state) do
    {active_users, expired_users} = partition_users_by_heartbeat(state.users)
    
    # Notify via PubSub about expired users
    expired_users
    |> Enum.each(fn {user_id, _} ->
      PubSub.broadcast(PubSub, "session:room", {:user_timeout, user_id})
    end)
    
    {:noreply, %{state | users: active_users}}
  end
end
```

### 4. **Agent for Monitoring and Metrics**

Elixir Agents provide simple state storage for monitoring:

```elixir
# In application.ex
{Agent, fn -> %{} end, [name: CollaborativeWebsocket.ReliabilityMonitor]}

# Usage for real-time metrics
Agent.update(ReliabilityMonitor, fn state ->
  Map.update(state, :events_sent, 1, &(&1 + 1))
end)

metrics = Agent.get(ReliabilityMonitor, & &1)
```

### 5. **Automatic Channel Reconnection**

Phoenix Channels handle reconnection automatically with exponential backoff:

```javascript
// Client-side: Built-in reconnection logic
this.socket = new Phoenix.Socket('/socket', {
  reconnectAfterMs: (tries) => [1000, 5000, 10000][tries - 1] || 10000,
  rejoinAfterMs: (tries) => [1000, 2000, 5000][tries - 1] || 5000
});

// Channels automatically rejoin after reconnection
this.channel.join()
  .receive('ok', () => console.log('Joined'))
  .receive('error', () => console.log('Failed'))
  .receive('timeout', () => console.log('Timeout'));
```

## Architecture Comparison: Rust vs Phoenix

| Feature | Rust + Axum | Phoenix Channels |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| **Connection Management** | Manual WebSocket handling | Built-in Channel abstraction |
| **Message Routing** | Manual broadcast tracking | Phoenix.PubSub automatic routing |
| **Acknowledgments** | Custom protocol | Built-in Channel replies |
| **Reconnection** | Manual retry logic | Automatic with exponential backoff |
| **Process Monitoring** | Manual heartbeat | OTP supervision + process monitoring |
| **State Recovery** | Manual state reconstruction | GenServer automatic restart + state |
| **Distributed Scaling** | Single node | Multi-node with PubSub clustering |
| **Error Handling** | Manual error propagation | OTP fault tolerance |

## Elixir/Phoenix-Specific Advantages

### 1. **OTP Fault Tolerance**
```elixir
# If ReliableSessionState crashes, supervisor restarts it
# All users automatically reconnect via Phoenix Channels
# State can be recovered from persistent storage or snapshots
```

### 2. **Process Isolation**
```elixir
# Each channel runs in its own process
# User disconnection doesn't affect other users
# Process crashes are isolated and recovered
```

### 3. **Built-in Clustering**
```elixir
# Phoenix.PubSub works across multiple nodes
# Users can connect to different servers
# Events are automatically distributed
```

### 4. **Hot Code Reloading**
```elixir
# GenServer state is preserved during code updates
# Channels can be updated without disconnecting users
# Zero-downtime deployments possible
```

config :collaborative_websocket, CollaborativeWebsocket.PubSub,
  adapter: Phoenix.PubSub.Redis,  # For multi-node clustering
  url: System.get_env("REDIS_URL")
```

### Monitoring Integration
```elixir
# Use Phoenix LiveDashboard for real-time metrics
# Agent state can be exposed via Telemetry events
# GenServer state monitoring via :observer
```

### Persistence Layer
```elixir
# Events can be persisted via Ecto
# GenServer state can use :dets or external DB
# Snapshots for fast recovery
```
